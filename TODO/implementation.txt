TODO Assigned weights of connections must be stored
     it seems weights have to be unique, if true this should be enforced
TODO find suitable open source database which fits to BSD license
     postgresql seems bsd compatible
TODO develop concept for word database persistence (maybe outside network)
     database can be referred by tool user and probably AI (=KI) in performing mode
TODO LATER when first implementation is working a authorization implementation might 
     be necessary (e.g. admin / end user)
